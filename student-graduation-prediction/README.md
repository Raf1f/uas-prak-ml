# Student Graduation Prediction

This repository implements machine learning models to predict student graduation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The dataset is sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, normalization)
- Model training and testing
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Visualization (confusion matrix)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `python src/main.py`

## Dataset
Dataset: [Student Performance Data Set (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)
